Video Captions:
Compartment is the most discriminat variable in Principal Cooordinate Analysis (PCoA), Biome and Country effect are not clearly identifiable as major variance partitioning variable.
Videos are obtained through 3D representation of PCoA (capscale) based on bray-curtis distance. Indicated black dots represent the centroids of each variable and are indicated as well in the videos (Compartment, Biome, Country).
Turquoise dots represent the samples, and colored dots represent the OTUs, respectively: BLUE (video1) - Bacteria; ORANGE (video2) - Fungi; MAGENTA: (video3) Oomycetes; GREEN:(video4) Overlooked microbial eukaryotes.
